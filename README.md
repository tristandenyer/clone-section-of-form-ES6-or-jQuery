# Duplicate a section of a form, maintaining accessibility (a11y)

Using jQuery or plain JavaScript (ES6), you can now duplicate a section of a form (as well as destroy the last cloned section), the whole form, or just one or two inputs. This also allows the user to add an empty form section with unique, iterative `ID`, `for`, `name`, and `label` to maintain accessibility (a11y) and work with the database.

To help you get a jumpstart on this, the .js files are well-commented.

## Overview

A more detailed overview [can be found here](https://tristandenyer.com/using-jquery-to-duplicate-a-section-of-a-form-maintaining-accessibility/ "can be found here"). I will be working on porting it over to this page soon. (Still working on this todo.)

## jQuery version

The jQuery version has been in development since June 2013, and is more stable, at the moment.

## ES6 JavaScript version

The ES6 version was a direct port over from the jQuery version. While it works in the same way the jQuery one does, there are some notable todos and refactoring that needs to be done before it can be used in production environments.

## History

This plugin was originally maintained on my website. A full version history, as well as an introduction, [can be found here](https://tristandenyer.com/using-jquery-to-duplicate-a-section-of-a-form-maintaining-accessibility/ "can be found here").

All future development will be maintained here, in GitHub.
